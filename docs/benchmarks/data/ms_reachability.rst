Info
----

For each graph we provide the following benchmark information:

- queries - regular gueries in the form of regular expressions
- results - pares of <src, dest> vertices where 'src' is a source vertice, 'dest' - a vertice reachable from source vertice
- src_verts - list of source vertices for running a benchmark
