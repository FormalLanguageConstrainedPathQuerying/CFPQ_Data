# linkcheck: Wikipedia rate-limits datacenter IPs even for sequential
# requests, answering 403 (and escalating to 429 + Retry-After under
# sustained load), and the block can outlast short retry bursts (verified
# 2026-09-18 in both directions: a 403 that answered 200 moments later, and
# one that persisted past ~2 minutes of retries). Retry transient failures
# inside the session — the path both linkcheck and intersphinx go through.
# For a Wikipedia rate-limit response (403 or 429) that survives the fast
# retries, normalise it to 429 + Retry-After: 60 so sphinx's native
# rate-limit machinery re-queues the link at one-minute spacing (hammering
# the endpoint only keeps the block active) instead of failing the build.
# The re-queueing is bounded per host — the limit is per IP, not per URL:
# after _MAX_RATE_LIMIT_ROUNDS rate-limited responses from wikipedia.org the
# budget stays pinned for the rest of the run, so every subsequent Wikipedia
# link is returned unmodified and sphinx reports it broken (a 403 fails at
# once; a 429 without Retry-After gives up after one more capped back-off
# round); the check therefore always terminates in ~15 minutes. The budget
# is deliberately never reset on success: under a flapping block
# (intermittent 200s amid persistent 403s, verified 2026-09-18) a
# success-based reset renewed the budget for every URL and the check ran
# past 30 minutes. If the block lifts after the budget is spent, the
# remaining Wikipedia links are reported broken — re-run the check.
