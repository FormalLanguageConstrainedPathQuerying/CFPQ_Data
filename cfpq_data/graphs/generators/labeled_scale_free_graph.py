    """Returns a scale-free directed graph. With labeled edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : integer
        Number of nodes in graph.

    alpha : float
        Probability for adding a new node connected to an existing node
        chosen randomly according to the in-degree distribution.

    beta : float
        Probability for adding an edge between two existing nodes.
        One existing node is chosen randomly according the in-degree
        distribution and the other chosen randomly according to the out-degree
        distribution.

    gamma : float
        Probability for adding a new node connected to an existing node
        chosen randomly according to the out-degree distribution.

    delta_in : float
        Bias for choosing nodes from in-degree distribution.

    delta_out : float
        Bias for choosing nodes from out-degree distribution.

    labels: Iterable[str]
        Labels that will be used to mark the edges of the graph.

    choice: Callable[[Iterable[str]], str]
        Function for marking edges.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from cfpq_data import *
    >>> g = labeled_scale_free_graph(42, seed=42)
    >>> g.number_of_nodes()
    42
    >>> g.number_of_edges()
    81

    Returns
    -------
    g : MultiDiGraph
        A scale-free directed graph.

    Notes
    -----
    The sum of `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` must be 1.
