    With labeled edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : Union[int, Iterable[Any]]
        The number of nodes in the first cycle without a common node.
        If n is an integer, nodes are from `range(n)`.
        If n is a container of nodes, those nodes appear in the graph.

    m : Union[int, Iterable[Any]]
        The number of nodes in the second cycle without a common node.
        If m is an integer, nodes are from `range(n)`.
        If m is a container of nodes, those nodes appear in the graph.

    common : Union[int, Any]
        The node along which two cycles are connected.

    edge_labels: Tuple[str, str]
        Labels that will be used to mark the edges of the graph.

    verbose : bool
        If true, a progress bar will be displayed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import cfpq_data
    >>> g = cfpq_data.labeled_two_cycles_graph(42, 29, verbose=False)
    >>> g.number_of_nodes()
    72
    >>> g.number_of_edges()
