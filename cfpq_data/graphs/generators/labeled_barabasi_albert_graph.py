    A graph of `number_of_nodes` nodes is grown by attaching new nodes each with
    `number_of_edges` edges that are preferentially attached to existing nodes with high degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_nodes : int
        Number of nodes.

    number_of_edges : int
        Number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes.

    seed : Union[int, RandomState, None]
        Indicator of random number generation state.

    edge_labels: Iterable[str]
        Labels that will be used to mark the edges of the graph.

    verbose : bool
        If true, a progress bar will be displayed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import cfpq_data
    >>> g = cfpq_data.labeled_barabasi_albert_graph(42, 29, 42, verbose=False)
    >>> g.number_of_nodes()
    42
    >>> g.number_of_edges()
    754

    Returns
    -------
    g : MultiDiGraph
        A random graph according
        to the Barabási–Albert preferential attachment model.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `m` does not satisfy ``1 <= m < n``.
