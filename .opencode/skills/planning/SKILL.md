# Planning

## Multi-task Planning

When the user asks to work on a **set of tasks** (several task IDs), do NOT jump
directly into implementation. First create a high-level global plan in
`tasks/global_plan.md`.

The global plan must:

- List all tasks to be done with their IDs and brief descriptions.
- Identify dependencies between tasks (which must be done before which).
- Identify potential conflicts or overlapping changes (e.g., two tasks
  modifying the same file).
- Identify shared infrastructure (types, helpers, utilities) that multiple
  tasks need. Create shared modules to avoid duplication across tasks.
- Identify existing reusable abstractions (types, helper functions, generators)
  that new tasks should use rather than reinvent.
- **Reuse analysis**: load the `reusing` skill and run the reuse checklist
  against existing code and documentation before creating new material.
- For each task that involves rendering/visualization, note that rendering and
  algorithm logic must be in separate modules from the start.
- Propose an execution order that minimizes rework and avoids conflicts.
- Align tasks with the project architecture.

After the global plan is created, proceed with the normal working loop: one task
at a time, feature branch per task, detailed plan in `tasks/detailed_plan.md`
for each.

## Detailed Plan (Atomic Subtasks)

`tasks/detailed_plan.md` MUST decompose the task into atomic subtasks. Each
subtask:

- Is small enough to complete in a single focused work session (typically
  30–90 minutes).
- Produces a compilable, testable increment — no partial implementations left
  uncommitted.
- Has a unique identifier (e.g., "S1", "S2") used in commit messages and plan
  tracking.

If a task is ambiguous or underspecified **during planning** (conflicting
requirements, unclear scope, missing constraints), do not guess. Ask the user
for clarification, then transfer the guidance to the task per the
`user-guidance-transfer` skill before proceeding with decomposition.

Before writing the detailed plan, load the `reusing` skill and run the reuse
checklist: search existing documentation and code for functions, types, and doc
sections that can be reused or generalized. Record what is reused in each
subtask's **Code** section.

### Subtask Format

Each subtask in `tasks/detailed_plan.md` MUST include these four sections. **A
subtask with missing Code, Tests, or Docs sections is incomplete and must not
be executed.**

```
### SN: <title>

**Code:** <files to create or modify, types and functions to add>
**Tests:** <test files to create or modify, specific test approaches:
           golden, property-based, pytest, etc.>
**Docs:** <doc files to create or update. Use the `documentation` skill
         to determine which docs are affected.>

**Spec:**
- <detailed implementation specification>
```

Example:

```
### S1: Add graph generator to CSV export

**Code:** New file `cfpq_data/graphs/generators/labeled_cycle_graph.py`
          with a `labeled_cycle_graph` function
**Tests:** New `tests/graphs/generators/test_labeled_cycle_graph.py`
          verifying node/edge counts and labels
**Docs:** Add to `docs/reference/graphs/graphs_generators.rst` autosummary;
          numpydoc docstring with `Examples`

**Spec:**
- Return a `nx.MultiDiGraph` of `n` cyclically connected nodes ...
```

### Documentation Mapping

For the mapping of source changes to required doc actions, load the
`documentation` skill — it is the single source of truth. Use it when writing
the **Docs** section of each subtask.

### Granularity

If a subtask cannot be committed as a self-contained increment, it is too large
— split it further. Commit rules live in the `git-workflow` skill (single
source of truth).

### Bounded uncommitted work

Uncommitted work on a feature branch must never exceed one atomic subtask. If a
session is interrupted, the loss is bounded to that single subtask.

## Post-Implementation Design Notes

When a task hits algorithmic limitations — partially completed, with skipped
tests or remaining work — append a `## Design Notes` section to
`tasks/detailed_plan.md`. This serves as persistent design knowledge for future
task refinement. The section must be structured as follows:

```
## Design Notes (discovered during implementation)

### <Topic Title>

Design rationale, coordinate spaces, invariants — as confirmed by the user.

### <Failure Topic Title>

- Root causes with concrete examples (e.g., "for input `aa`, the edge
  (5,0)→(7,2) has no entries because...")
- What was attempted and why it didn't fully work
- Remaining work: concrete, actionable items
- Skipped tests: list them and the reason
```

Requirements:

- Every algorithmic limitation MUST be traceable to a concrete input, a
  concrete location in the data structure, and a concrete execution path in
  the code.
- Never write vague descriptions like "some entries are missing" — specify
  which input, which state/range, and which path should produce them.
- Remaining work items must be actionable (e.g., "Track origin state through
  the BFS queue by adding a field to the queue item") — not vague goals.
- If the user provided design guidance (e.g., decomposition schema, coordinate
  system), record it verbatim in the `### <Topic>` section as the
  authoritative reference.

## Task Authoring Guidelines

When writing a new task for `tasks/tasks.md`, follow these rules:

- **Specify output format upfront**. If the task involves TeX or dot
  visualization, include the exact column layout, math mode conventions, and
  formatting rules in the task description.
- **Keep tasks single-responsibility**. A task should do one thing. If it
  requires more than 5 sub-items or spans multiple unrelated concerns, split it
  into multiple tasks.
- **Specify equivalence requirements**. For any new algorithm variant,
  explicitly state "must produce results identical to X" so equivalence tests
  are built from the start.
- **Specify type genericity**. If a module must handle arbitrary types, state
  it explicitly (e.g., "generic over terminal and nonterminal types").
- **Specify reuse expectations**. If the task builds on existing infrastructure
  (e.g., "reuse the labeled graph generators from `cfpq_data/graphs`"), name
  the dependencies. This prevents reinvention.

## Task Completeness Verification

See the `subtask-loop` skill — it is the single source of truth for verifying
task completion before marking a task `[done]` in `tasks/tasks.md`.
